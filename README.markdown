textobj-comment
===============

This Vim plugin provides text objects for comments, available in Visual and
Operator-pending mode.

* `ac` selects a comment including the comment delimiters
* `ic` selects just the comment content
* `iC` selects a comment including trailing or leading whitespace.
* `aC` selects a comment including adjacent ones only separated by an empty or whitespace-only line.

This plugin uses the `'comments'` and `'commentstring'` settings to
determine what a comment looks like for a given filetype. It works with
both `/* paired */` and `// simple` comment delimiters.

This plugin depends on the [textobj-user][1] plugin.

Usage
-----

Comprehensive on-line documentation is included and available at
`:h textobj-comment`.

Below is a quick demo of the 'a comment' text object. The command used
is `vac`. The targeted area is the same for analogous commands using an
operator, such as `dac`, `cac`, and `gqac`.

The 'inner comment' text object targets the inside of a comment. Here I
use `cic`:

Installation
------------

Move the files into their respective directories inside your `~/.vim`
directory (or your `$HOME\vimfiles` directory if you're on Windows).

With [pathogen.vim][3] the installation is as simple as:

    git clone git://github.com/glts/vim-textobj-comment.git ~/.vim/bundle/textobj-comment

This plugin also plays well with other plugin managers.

Don't forget to install textobj-user, too, if your setup doesn't take
care of dependencies automatically.

Development
-----------

The code isn't pretty. If you look closely you'll notice a lot of effort
being made to cover corner cases and make the behaviour of the text
objects as similar to the built-ins as possible. That said, if you are
interested in working on it, use the test suite to make sure you don't
break anything.

The test suite is written using [vspec][4].

`make test` runs the whole suite and `make t/<test>.vim` runs a specific
test. You may need to adapt the paths to the vspec executable and to the
runtime path directories at the top of the Makefile.
